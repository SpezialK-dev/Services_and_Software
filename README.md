# What this repo is about

This is a collection of services as well as software that you might not know about. 

I try to archive a high degree of quality when it comes to what I write here as well as to what services I recommend.  

# Are you missing a service or piece of Software?

There are two things you can do. Either you can use one of the [templates](./templates/) and write it yourself and make a pull request. Or you can make an issue with the name and link to the website to the software and service that you want me to look at.
