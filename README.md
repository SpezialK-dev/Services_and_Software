# What this repo is about

This is a collection of services as well as software that you might not know about. 

I try to archive a high degree of quality when it comes to what I write here as well as to what services I recommend.  

# Are you missing a service or piece of Software?

There are two things you can do. Either you can use one of the [templates](./templates/) and write it yourself and make a pull request. Or you can make an issue with the name and link to the website to the software and service that you want me to look at. 


# Found a mistake ?

I am happy if you make a pul request, if it is something that is more of a spelling error/ just rewriting it with better grammar you don't need a source. But if it is something related to the content of what I/ another person write please include a source so that I can fact check what you are saying.
