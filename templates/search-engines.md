*1 = you don't have to visit a website to get the information / it has a summary without clicking on the link. \\
*2 = switch to images/ text search/ shopping\\
*3 = !otherSearchEngine to directly search on a different search engine without having to switch to said website.\\ 

### Tests

To test this out we will use 2 different browsers on the same machine, if possible use a vpn to appear somewhere different in your country, because if you switch to a different country it might impact your search results. This localizing I don't see as a problem since it is easily bypassable via a vpn or proxy. And it is not Targeted. 

We then will take a look on how on topic are the results. 

Search-queries

- microsoft teams login


How to interpret the results:

- Does it give you a link to the login? Does it lead to something else, does it give you a wikipedia article. 

### Textual search

#### Tests
I will enter this query and write what  

#### Code 
This category is not important for everyone!

##### Tests

Here we will focus on the quality of the answers give. Here we do not care about tracking but rather if the results work and if they are from sources like stackoverflow or other known sources. 

If you cannot test write it into your Pull request!

Search-queries

- c++ check length of an array
- python get commandline flags

##### Results


### Image search

#### Tests
To see how on topic are the results that we get. 


Here are the search-queries

- Iphone 14
- apple
- speech bubble png


How to interpret the results

- For the Iphone 14 we actually want pictures of the Iphone 14. We use this since this should only give results of the phone not something else.
- apple here we want to see if it gives us the company logo or if it gives us the fruit. 
- with the speech bubble png we want transparent images that are actual png's thought here even better search engines fail sometimes
